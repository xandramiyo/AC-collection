# AC-Collection

Animal Crossing: New Horizons has really stepped up the creative ceiling of fans of the franchise and pictures of players' island layouts and interior home designs have showered the internet since the game's release in 2019. But one of the main draws of the franchise, since the original game released on the GameCube remains its eclectic cast of animal NPCs, known as villagers. I created this application to serve as a platform for users to keep track of their favorite villagers and have a place to display pictures and congregates notes on each one.
